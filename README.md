# ghostmod
This mod adds an item that allows the player creative flight and noclip while held. Additionally makes the player unable to be damaged by anything other than magic or enchanted weapons.
Also adds ghost versions of some mobs, and a potion that removes the ghost ability. Ghost mobs only target ghost players and vice versa.
